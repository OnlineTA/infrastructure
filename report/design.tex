\chapter{System Architecture Design}
In this chapter, we propose a design for our system. We will use the
principles that we laid down in the previous chapter and present them
as a part of an integrated system

\section{General concepts and overall goal}
With security as the, as previously stated, principal goal, we focus
our design around several small processes, each with a well defined
purpose and interactions. We furthermore enforce a principle of
minimum permissions across our entire system.

\subsection{Container support}
The design of the system enables the containerization model to be
swapped, such that different containers can be used for the assessment
of different assignments. Supporting this modularity is important
since different assignments and teachers may have varying demands of
the container used for assessment.

\section{Users}
There are two levels of users in the OnlineTA system. One is the user
owning the daemons responsible for handling the main assessment flow,
and the other is the users owning the submissions. In the case of
anonymous submissions

\subsection{Representing users on system}
Name service lookup services in GNU/Linux systems are provided by the
Name Service Switch (NSS) subsystem which is implemented in the GNU
C Library (glibc). Lookup databases include users, groups and DNS
names. The NSS system provides a unified interface for performing
lookups in a database backed by multiple services. The NSS system is
extensible through services which is called in the order specified by
the \texttt{/etc/nssswitch.conf} file. In the OnlineTA system, we add a
password mapping module which can be used for looking up user names to
UIDs and vice-verca\cite{nss}.

This allows us to represent our dynamically created users on the Linux
system and thus avoid having to define them statically in the
\texttt{/etc/passwd} file.

We perform user handling in two separate NSS modules for handling
named an anonymous submission respectively. The usernames of
identified submissions are assigned by an NSS module which implements
the bidirectional UID to KU-username mapping previously described.
conversion scheme previously described.

We handle the usernames of anonymous submissions slightly
differently through a different NSS module. This module works on lists
of preallocated users and is autonomously responsible for maintaining
lists of allocated and non-allocated users \fxnote{rewrite}

\section{Storage}
In our current design, availability of persistent local disk storage
is assumed. The directory structure used for storing submission data
is as follows (\cref{fig:filetree}):

\begin{description}
\item{\texttt{submissions}} The parent of the directory tree
\item{\texttt{<UUID>}} A directory named after the UUID assigned to
  a submission is placed as a sub directory of the submissions
  directory. It holds all the files related to a submission, including
  it's assessment.  he contents of this directory are owned by the user
  who made the submission and thus it can only be accessed by an
  assessment unit running as this user.
\item{\texttt{incoming}} This directory is where the metadata files of
  all newly created directories are stored. It is monitored by the
  scheduler using \texttt{inotify} which, after a metadata file is
  scheduled it is moved away from this directory
\item{\texttt{accepted}} This directory holds metadata files which has
  been accepted for processing. The separation of incoming and
  accepted metadata files is needed due to limitations of inotify \fxnote{elaborate}

  assignment (UUID3) has been accepted an scheduled, while two

\section{Capabilities}
In \cref{sec:cap} we introduced the concept of capabilities. In this
section, we will describe the properties\cite{cap7} of the specific capabilities
that are referred to henceforth.

\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{CAP\_CHOWN}] The process in possession of this
  capability can use the \texttt{chown} syscall to change the owner of
  any file or folder on the system.
\item[\texttt{CAP\_SUID}] Allows a process to freely change its
  effective UID.
\item[\texttt{CAP\_SETPCAP}] This capability allows a process to
  either add a capability from the bounding set of capabilities
  inherited from its calling process or drop a capability from its
  current set.
\item[\texttt{CAP\_SYSADM}] This capability allows a process to
  perform a large number of administrative tasks. We are primarily
  interested in using the \texttt{mount} syscall to prepare the
  filesystems used for assessment.
%\item{\texttt{}}
\end{description}

\section{Components}
Our proposed design for the OnlineTA system is split onto a number of
different components which are described in this section. Their
relationship is shown in \cref{fig:arch}.

\begin{figure}

\caption{Flowchart showing interactions between the components of the
  OnlineTA system}
\label{fig:arch}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Frontend}
The frontend is responsible for accepting submissions. In case of
attributed submissions it is also responsible for verifying the
identity of the user submitting the assignment. It will also perform
the initial storage of the submission. Furthermore, the frontend is
responsible for returning the assessment to the student.

%It will go through the following steps in order to accept an
%assignment.

The frontend has the following roles
\begin{itemize}
\item Accepting submissions from the HTTP proxy
\item Verify GPG signature of assignment to verify submission
  attribution
\item Generating and assigning a UUID to the submission
\item Writing the initial metadata file
\item Creating directory for containing the submission and setting
  ownership of files \fxnote{It would be nice to state that the "work queue" is just a folder of folders, each owned by the respective user that made the submission.}
\end{itemize}

This component require the \texttt{CAP\_CHOWN} capability and write
access to the submission root folder.

\paragraph{Scheduler}
The scheduler will pick up the assignment after it has been saved to
disk and pair it with a suitable assessment unit. Assignment
scheduling is based primarily on a priority assigned to the submission
by the frontend. Submissions with equal priorities are scheduled on a
FIFO basis. If no priority is provided by the assignment, it could
assign a priority based on a number of factors, e.g. time remaining
before submission deadline. The scheduler directly spawns processes for
executing assessment units.

The scheduler has the following roles:
\begin{itemize}
\item Monitoring the incoming directory for new submissions
\item Pairing submissions with an appropriate assessment unit
\item Scheduling and prioritizing assessment of assignments
\item Invoking workers for performing the actual assignment
\end{itemize}

The scheduler does not need any special capabilities, but it requires
read and write permissions to the metadata queue directory.


\paragraph{Worker}
A worker process is spawned by the scheduler and its overall purpose
is to set up and initiate the assessment process. It is initially
started as the \texttt{onlineta} user but after the assessment
environment has been configured and the containers has been created it
will \texttt{suid} to the user owning the submission and thereby shed its special
capabilities.

Specifically, its roles are the following
\begin{itemize}
\item Setting up the environment for performing an assessment
  including mounting filesystems
\item Setting up containers for assessment
\item Relaying assessment to frontend
\end{itemize}

The special capabilities required by the Worker process are
\texttt{CAP\_SYSADM}, \texttt{CAP\_SUID} and \texttt{CAP\_SETPCAP}

\paragraph{Assessment units}
An assessment unit handles the actual assessment of an assignment.

%what is the individual role of each of the components and what is the 

\section{Interactions}
The scope of the current implementation is limited to supporting
direct interactions via a web browser, however, the additional modes
of interaction previously described can be implemented on top of the
interface that we will describe in this section.

In the current design, all interactions with the system occurs over a
secure HTTP connection. We use the first part of the request URI to
determine which action is requested by the user while subsequent URI
components are used as parameters for that request. The system
supports the following actions:

\begin{description}

\item[\texttt{/}] This URI can be issued as a HTTP GET request and
  will return the main index page which will contain a list of courses
  and assignments availiable on that server
\item[\texttt{/submit/<course>/<assignment>/}] When a HTTP POST
    request is issued to this URL it will be handled as an anonymous
    submission. If the submission is accepted, the fronted will
    repsond with a page showing the assigned submission UUID. This
    UUID can then be used in order to retrieve assessments once they
    are completed
\item[\texttt{/submit/<course>/<assignment>/<KU-username>}] This
  request type is the same as the previous except that it will perform
  an attributed submission. Thus, an assignment submitted through this
  request will only be accepted if all of its constituents are signed
  by the GPG-key mapped to the proclaimed user.

\item[\texttt{/query/<uuid>}] Used to query assessment status of
  assignment identified by given UUID. This request is site-effect free and
  can thus never alter the state of the system. The status of an assignment can
  be the following
  \begin{description}
    \item[ACCEPTED] The assignment has been accepted and is
      awaiting schediling
    \item[QUEUED] The assignment has been picked up by the
      scheduler and is awaiting prioirization
    \item[PROCESSING] The assignment is in the process of being assessed
    \item[FINISHED] Assessment has been successfully completed
    \item[FAILED] Assessment has failed
  \end{description}
\item[\texttt{/assessment/<uuid>}] Retrieves the assessment of a
  submission if available. This request is not nullipotent since the
  assessments of anonymous submissions will cease to be available once
  this request has been performed.
\end{description}

\subsection{Relaying assessment to user}

%\section{Scaling and distributing}
%A driving idea behind our design is to enable horizontal
%scalability. A key element to acheiving this

%\fxnote{
%What do you mean by horizontal scalability?
%Another thing I think is missing is an explanation of how this is handled course-wise? E.g. one server per course.}



\section{Large Submissions}
Some courses may require large submissions which could saturate
any feasible internet link through only a limited number of concurrent
uploads. We propose that the upload bandwidth requirement can be
reduced by applying a delta transfer algorithm on repeated
submissions.

The rsync algorithm is an abvious candidate for solving this
problem. However, the alogrim assumes that the receiving end has
access to all files. Honoring our porperty of minimal user permissions
the submission receiving process won't have access to the files of the
previous submissions. We therefore propose a variation of the rsync
algorithm built for our purpose. Since we cannot rely on being able to
retrieve the state of the remote files we must be able to keep the
difference between local and remote files locally. TODO

TODO: Finish and compare to git (Why cant git perform the differential
transfer?
