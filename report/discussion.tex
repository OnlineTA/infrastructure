\chapter{Conclusions}
The purpose of this project, was to serve as a starting point for the
design and implementation of the OnlienTA system.

We believe that the design that we have proposed in this report will
provide a solid foundation for the continued work of implementing the
OnlineTA.

Unfortunately, as we have previously mentioned, we have not been able
to present a complete working implementation of our proposed
design. While this lack of definite results weakens our ability to
make firm recommendations 




Due to the aforementioned lack of a complete implementation

However, our proof of concept implementation is sufficiently complete
that we have been able to confirm many of the assertions that we
present in this report.




\section{Future work}
The primary priority in the further development of this product is to
complete the implementation of the design described in this
report. T
