\chapter{Introduction}
In this report, we will describe the design and implementation of an
infrastructure for the submission and automated correction of student
assignment.

\section{Background and motivation}
As a result of a university reform recently passed by the Danish
goverment, students are being pushed faster through their university
education. One of the consequences of this is that student TA's are
becoming harder to find since students can no longer find the time to
act as TA's alongside their studies.

This has sparked a general interest at DIKU\footnote{Department of
  Computer Science, University of Copenhagen} to take advantage of
automated assignment correction systems with the purpose of reducing
the workload burdening student TA's.

Since many courses in Computer Science (CS) asks students to complete
a large amount of programming homework, Computer Science(CS) finds
itself in a unique position to take advantage of automated assignment
correction systems Compared to many other fields of study.

The system that this report will describe is only intended as a
support for TA's and will not replace the work that they perform
entirely.
