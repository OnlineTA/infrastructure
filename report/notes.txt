   - User managemebt
      - Anonymous (UID pool)
      - Onymous/Person identified (Base36 conversion)
 - Containerization
   - Security roles
     - TA's and teachers is allowed to have elevated permissions compared to students
   - Security aspects of docker vs. sandstone
     - Sandstone: more minimal permissions
     - ``built for purpose''
     - Docker: Standardized deployment
     - Dockerfiles
     - Reviewed codebases
